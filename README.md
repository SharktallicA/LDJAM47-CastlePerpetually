# LDJAM47-CastlePerpetually
Our team's entry for Ludum Dare 47 (2nd to 5th October 2020) game jam. With the given theme "stuck in a loop" for this jam, our game is a 2D dungeon-themed room hopper where you have to take your chance with doors in each room to progress. More often than not, you'll strike a door that will take you to the very beginning, but you can complete one or more tasks per room to improve your chances with the doors.

## Behind the scenes
Our team is comprised of entirely of programmers and we decided to take up the challenge of a 2D game when our experience has almost entirely been developing 3D games. Considering that and our day-time jobs, we decided to keep the idea simple and effectively. In terms of the finished product, it's not as polished as we like and we didn't have time for audio, but we still believe we've got a solid foundation for a game that we can continue to develop in the future!
