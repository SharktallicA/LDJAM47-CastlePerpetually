# LDJAM47-CastlePerpetually
Our team's entry for Ludum Dare 47 (2nd to 5th October 2020) game jam. With the given theme "stuck in a loop" for this jam, our game is a 2D dungeon-themed room hopper where you have to take your chance with doors in each room to progress. More often than not, you'll strike a door that will take you to the very beginning, but you can complete one or more tasks per room to improve your chances with the doors.
